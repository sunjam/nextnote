<p>This app is considered an <strong><span style=background-color:#0ff;color:red>ALPHA</span></strong> release. <strong>Complete note loss is to be expected</strong> until <a href=https://github.com/brantje/nextnote/issues/50>sharing is fixed</a>, <a href=https://github.com/brantje/nextnote/issues/49>a version 1.0 release is added to the Nextcloud Appstore</a> and basic <a href=https://github.com/brantje/nextnote/issues/96 rel=noopener target=_blank>note import/export functionality</a> is implemented.</p>
